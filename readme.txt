TRAIN SCHEDULER

-----WHAT I DID-----
For this project we were integrating moment.js and firebase into our skillset. My understanding is that firebase isn't used very often and will be less important once we work on back-end programming. I enjoyed this project, but ran into several challenges along the way. The current format doesn't run the way I'd like and there seems to be something that causes a memory leak.  

-----WHAT I LEARNED-----
I enjoyed using firebase and found it easy to use. Moment.js is a convenient functionality that will be used in so many instances that I really need to play with it more to become more familiar with it moving forward. I learned how to have the page autorefresh through html. 


-----WHAT'S NEXT-----
This project could use some work. I ended up writing a convoluted function that uses unnecessary coding to calculate the minutes used in the scheduler. I also want to have the train schedule div update automatically without refreshing the whole page.
